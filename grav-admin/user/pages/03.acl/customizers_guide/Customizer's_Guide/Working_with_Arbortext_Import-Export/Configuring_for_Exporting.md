# Deploying_Export_Stylesheets

As with all stylesheet s, Export stylesheets are made available to client workstations from the Arbortext Publishing Engine server. Once your Export stylesheet(s) have been created and tested, copy them to your Arbortext Publishing Engine server's \custom\importexport directory and restart your Arbortext Publishing Engine server.

Refer to Overview of Custom Programs and Scripts for details on working with the \custom directory.
