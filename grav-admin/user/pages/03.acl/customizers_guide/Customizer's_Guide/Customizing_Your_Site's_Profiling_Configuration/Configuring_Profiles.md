# Configuration_Process

Before actually configuring your profiling, determine the proper profiles to create for your site. Consider the following items:

- • Create profiles so that your biggest possible audience does not require that any profiles are applied. This will cut down on the time needed to profile a document.

- • Determine whether it will be more work to profile a document to include elements or exclude elements. It may create less work for authors if you create a NOT Model 123 profile instead of a Model 123 profile.

- • Avoid creating profiles that are subsets of one another. For example, in the Security profile class, do not create a general Employees profile and specific Managers and Trainees profiles. This may cause problems for those applying the profiles. Instead of creating the general Employees profile, create the Managers and Trainees profiles.

Use the following procedures to create or update a profiling configuration file.

## Specifying the .pcf File to Use

## Configuring the Profiles

## Configuring Profile Shading
