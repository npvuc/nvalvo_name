# initADocumentEntityEvent_method

Initializes the value of an ADocumentEntityEvent created through the DocumentEntityEvent interface. You should only call this method before the ADocumentEntityEvent has been dispatched using the dispatchEvent method, though it can be called multiple times during that phase if necessary. If the initADocumentEntityEvent is called multiple times, the final call takes precedence.
