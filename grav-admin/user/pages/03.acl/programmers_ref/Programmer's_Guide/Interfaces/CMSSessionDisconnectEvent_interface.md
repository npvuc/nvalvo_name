# initCMSSessionDisconnectEvent_method

Initializes the value of an CMSSessionDisconnectEvent created through the CMSSessionDisconnectEvent interface. This method should only be called before the CMSSessionDisconnectEvent has been dispatched using the dispatchEvent method, though it may be called multiple times during that phase if necessary. If called multiple times, the final invocation takes precedence.
