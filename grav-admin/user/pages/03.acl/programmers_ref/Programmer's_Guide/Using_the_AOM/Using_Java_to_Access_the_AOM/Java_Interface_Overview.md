# Java_Interface_Platform_Requirements

The Java interface requires access to Oracleâ€™s Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which is included in the Arbortext Editor or Arbortext Publishing Engine installation in the Arbortext-path \bin\jre directory.

Refer to the Installation Guide for Arbortext Editor, Arbortext Styler, and Arbortext Architect or Installation Guide for Arbortext Publishing Engine for the most recent version support information.

To use a specific JVM, you need to specify it with the javavmpath ACL set option. To set the maximum size of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) memory allocation pool, use the APTJAVAVMMEMORY environment variable (sets the size of JVM on startup of Arbortext Editor ) or the javavmmemory ACL set option.
